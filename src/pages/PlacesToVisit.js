        From nature walks in gardens that makes one wonder whether Paradise, as depicted in scriptures of various cultures, have actually been derived from such sensory experiences to relaxing over a cup of tea from the tea plantations dotting the hillside, only to realize most humbly of nature’s gifts as a bountiful provider, the tourist places in Ooty can be expected to resuscitate the soul, depleted of its spiritual reserves through the trials of everyday existence.
